The spellcaster rapidly speeds up the passing of time in a small area of the structure, causing it to collapse. This can create a doorway-sized hole through any wall, which should be indicated on the table somehow. The spell can also be used to collapse a section of floor beneath a figure standing on a level above the ground. In this case, the figure about to be affected must pass a Move Roll (TN22) or fall to the next level down and taking damage appropriately. If this spell is cast on a wall created by the Wall spell, the wall is completely destroyed. If it is cast on terrain holding a Wizard Eye, the Wizard Eye is cancelled."

Place a bridge 6\" long and 2\" wide anywhere that is completely in the line of sight of the spellcaster. The bridge has no appreciable thickness and is essentially two-dimensional. The ends of this bridge do not have to be on the same horizontal plane, nor do the ends of the bridge need to be anchored on terrain, they may float in the air. Figures may move along this bridge at their normal movement rate, even when essentially climbing. Each spellcaster may only have one bridge in play at any time. Whenever the spellcaster activates, they may cancel this spell as a free action. Otherwise roll a die at the end of every turn: on a 1-2 the bridge vanishes. Figures on the bridge when it vanishes will fall to the ground."
